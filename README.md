<h2>Description of the Code</h2>
<p>This Java program demonstrates the Pipe and Filter design pattern, where a series of transformations (filters) are applied to a list of integers. The program uses a sequence of functions to process a list of numbers in a pipeline. The input list is filtered through multiple steps:</p>

Keeping even numbers.

Squaring each number.

Keeping only numbers greater than 10.

<h2>Adding a new filter</h2>
filterDivisibleByThree: Added to the pipeline to only keep numbers divisible by 3.
